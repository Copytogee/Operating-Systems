File Manager Manages your files by displaying them and allowing you to edit them. You can also copy, rename, and edit other stuff from the file manager. It also helps access other hard drives or usb drives that are installed on your computer.
Screen saver is a function that activates when you been away from your computer for a set amount of time. It used to play moving images from your gallery or something like old dos style maze or pipes. However now it just puts your computer to sleep pretty much going into low power mode and turning of the display, mouse and keyboard.
